# NAT (n8n Automated Templates)

This repository contains a curated collection of **n8n automation workflows** (NAT) built for real-world use cases — ranging from social media management to lead generation, content automation, notifications, and more.

Each workflow is organized into its own folder, with:

- A `workflow.json` file that you can directly import into your n8n instance
- A `README.md` explaining the logic, configuration steps, and usage instructions in plain language

---

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders listed in this repo to find the workflow you’re interested in.
2. Open the folder to read the explanation in `README.md`.
3. Import the `workflow.json` into your own n8n instance using the **Import** button.
4. Set up any required API credentials or integrations as described.

Each workflow is modular and fully customizable.
